CHEST X-RAY IMAGE SEGMENTATION ON SIIM ACR DATASET
Project Overview
The project aims to develop a deep learning model for semantic segmentation tasks, particularly for medical images. Semantic segmentation involves assigning a label to each pixel in an image, effectively dividing the image into regions of interest. In the medical field, semantic segmentation is crucial for tasks such as identifying organs, tumors, or anomalies in medical scans like X-rays or MRIs.

Key Functionalities
1. Data Preparation
•	The project involves working with medical image datasets, specifically in PNG format.
•	The `Dataset` class is responsible for loading and preprocessing the data. It reads image and mask files from specified directories, applies augmentations if provided, and returns them as tensors.

2. Model Architecture
•	The project implements a U-Net architecture, a popular choice for semantic segmentation tasks due to its effectiveness in capturing spatial information.
•	The `UNet` class defines the architecture, consisting of encoder and decoder layers for feature extraction and up-sampling, respectively.

3. Training and Evaluation
•	The project includes functions for training and evaluating the model.
•	Training is performed using the `train_one_epoch` function, which iterates over the training dataset, computes the loss, and updates the model parameters using backpropagation.
•	Evaluation is carried out using the `evaluate` function, which computes evaluation metrics such as the dice coefficient to assess model performance on the validation dataset.

4. Optimization and Early Stopping
•	The project utilizes the Adam optimizer for training the model with a specified learning rate.
•	It also incorporates a learning rate scheduler to adjust the learning rate during training based on predefined milestones.
•	Early stopping is implemented to prevent overfitting by monitoring validation performance. If validation performance does not improve for a specified number of epochs, training is stopped early.

5. Visualization:
•	The project includes visualization functionalities to monitor training and validation progress.
•	It plots training loss and validation dice score curves to visualize the model's performance over epochs and batches.

6. Model Saving and Resuming Training
•	The project provides functionality to save and resume model training from checkpoints.
•	Checkpoints include model parameters, optimizer state, and training statistics, allowing training to be resumed from the last saved state.

Overall, the project provides a comprehensive framework for developing and training semantic segmentation models for medical image analysis. It combines data preprocessing, model architecture definition, training, evaluation, and visualization functionalities to facilitate the development and deployment of deep learning models in medical imaging applications.
